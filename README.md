# Project 4: Data Visualization and Machine Learning on Diabetes Dataset

### Group Members: Juhi, Kesha, Lora, and Hima

### Description:
The goals of our project are to use data visualization techniques on a diabetes data set and to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts diabetes in patients using medical history and demographic information.

Using data from the World Bank, the IDF Diabetes Atlas, and the CDC, a Tableau dashboard was built to gain an overall understanding of diabetes globally and in the United States. Global prevalence, health expenditure, and demographic information relating to diabetes were investigated in this dashboard. DB browser in conjunction with SQLite were used to create a database for machine learning. Considering that the outcome is binary (i.e., patient has diabetes or does not have diabetes), classification machine learning models were choosen. Then, the balanced accuracy score was calculated using SMOTE for logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector classifier, and random forest classifier. The machine learning model with the highest random learning score was the random forest classifier. We evaluated random forest machine learning model with a confusion matrix and accuracy result chart.

### Conclusion:
Through the data analysis presented, there are relationships between variables and diabetes. Age, gender and location can be correlated with diagnosed diabetes. The data analyzed can build a further understanding into diabetes prevalence and predicting diabetes in individuals using demographic and risk factor variables.
