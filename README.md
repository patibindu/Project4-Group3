# Project 4: Diabetes in America

### Group Members: Juhi, Kesha, Lora, and Hima

### Description:
The goal of our project is to understand diabetes prevalence and to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts diabetes in patients using medical history and demographic information.

### Team Member Responsiblities: 
1. Maintain READ.me: Juhi, Lora
2. Brainstorm about this project: Everyone
3. Clean data: Everyone
4. Perform Descriptive Analysis: Juhi
5. Address Imbalanced Data: Hima, Kesha
6. Train and Test the Machine Learning model: Hima, Kesha
7. Build Tableau dashboard: Lora, Juhi
8. Develop presentation: Everyone

### Files:
Tableau Dashboard: Global, National, and North Carolina

Descriptive Analysis: diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv, Descriptive_analysis.ipynb, histogram_A1c.jpg, histogram_age.jpg, histogram_bmi.jpg, histogram_glucose.jpg, and histogram_all.jpg

Machine Learning Model: 

### Conclusion:
Through the data analysis presented, there are relationships between variables and diabetes. Age, gender and location can be correlated with diagnosed diabetes. The data analyzed can build a further understanding into diabetes prevalence and predicting diabetes in individuals using demographic and risk factor variables.
